"""Versioned schema migrations for the scan database.

The schema version lives in ``PRAGMA user_version`` (an integer in the SQLite
header, transactional, and readable before any table exists). ``upgrade()`` runs
every migration whose version is greater than the DB's current version, in
order, each in its own transaction — so an interrupted update leaves the DB at
the last fully-applied version rather than half-migrated.

**Migrations run automatically when a newer SDK opens an older database** —
``ScanDatabase._init_schema`` calls ``upgrade()`` on every open. A database
already at ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` costs one ``PRAGMA`` read and writes nothing, so
opening a read-only or up-to-date DB is unaffected.

Adding a migration
------------------
1. Write ``_migration_00N_<name>(conn)`` using individual ``conn.execute``
   calls. **Never use ``executescript`` inside a migration** — it issues an
   implicit COMMIT, which would break the surrounding transaction and defeat
   the all-or-nothing guarantee.
2. Append ``(N, "short description", _migration_00N_<name>)`` to ``MIGRATIONS``.
3. Bump ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` to N.
4. Write migrations defensively (``IF NOT EXISTS``, ``_add_column_if_missing``).
   Databases in the field predate versioning and report version 0 while already
   carrying the v1 schema, so migration 1 must be a no-op on them.

Backward compatibility: migration 1 is the historical schema exactly as
``_init_schema`` built it, and is fully idempotent, so an existing field
database baselines to v1 without touching a row.
