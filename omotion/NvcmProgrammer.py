"""NvcmProgrammer — burn a Lattice CrossLink NVCM image via a MotionSensor.

Replays Diamond-generated .iea/.ied I2C transactions over the sensor's
factory commands (OW_FACTORY_*). The default image is bundled in
omotion/nvcm/ (see README there for provenance).

NVCM is ONE-TIME programmable: a successful burn is permanent. The replay
performs full readback verification (omotion.i2c_parser), so a non-blank
or already-programmed device fails fast and corrupt burns cannot PASS.

The replay is deliberately paced (~2 ms per factory transaction, ~3 min per
camera) and each burn starts with a hard power-cycle of the target camera.
Burns faster than the paced envelope silently corrupt the array partway
through and permanently brick the part — see _SensorI2CDriver.
